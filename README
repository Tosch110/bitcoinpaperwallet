Then just look for the button that says "Download ZIP". Look to your right -->

This project is a fork of bitcoinpaperwallet.com, the initiative to generate secure,
trustworthy, save storage of Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin.

*** bitcoinpaperwallet.com ***

This project is a fork of bitaddress.org, the original trustworthy
JavaScript powered offline bitcoin address generator. 

This attractive paper wallet design is two-sided and folds up to
hide the private key. Optional tamper-evident hologram tape and/or a live-boot
Ubuntu CD with this software pre-installed can be purchased from bitcoinpaperwallet.com 
to provide additional security against snooping.

This generator includes the same pseudorandom key generation as bitaddress.org, as
well as support for creating wallets using "vanity keys", passphrases ("brain wallets")
or even rolling dice or shuffling cards.

This generator also includes support and designs for making
Litecoin and Dogecoin wallets.

Use the "Verify or Decrypt" tab to decrypt a BIP38 password-encrypted wallet, check the
integrity of any private key, or even duplicate an exising wallet by scanning its
QR code.

*** HOW TO USE THIS GENERATOR ***

1) Extract the ZIP file
2) Open up the 'generate-wallet.html' file with your web browser. 
3) If you like you can select a different language or holiday theme
4) Follow the steps for calibrating your printer and then printing
   the front and back of each wallet. Use landscape mode when printing!
   
Rendering and printing seems to work best using: 

   OS X:     Safari or Chrome or Firefox
   Windows:  Firefox or Chrome
   Linux:    Firefox

When using Chrome on Windows, use the Chrome print dialog. Switching to the
Windows system print dialog will produce corrupted/illegible keys.

QR scanning works best using Firefox since Chrome will not access the camera controls
when opening a locally saved HTML file.

*** COMPARED WITH BITADDRESS.ORG ***

Images and resources have been moved out of the .html file (where they were
base-64 encoded) and into an images directory to make the code easier to review.

All cryptographic functions are verifiably identical to those in bitaddress.org.
(Run a "diff" between this project and bitaddress.org if you want to be sure.)

*** HOW TO VERIFY THE AUTHENTICITY OF THIS DOWNLOAD ***

After downloading the ZIP package for this generator, you should find a file 
named generate-wallet.html.sig which you can use to:

* Verify that generate-wallet.html hasn't been tampered with

Now Bitcoin addresses and their corresponding private key can be conveniently 
generated in a web browser.

The bitaddress.org project provides an all-in-one HTML document with embedded
JavaScript/Css/Images. The JavaScript is readable not minified and contains no
XMLHttpRequest's (no AJAX). The benefit of this technique is you can load the 
JavaScript locally and trust that the JavaScript did not change after being 
loaded.

END USER NOTES: 
 1) To print QRCode in IE8 you must enable the "Print Background Colors and 
    Images" checkbox on the "Page Setup" screen.
 2) For Bulk Wallet I recommended using Google Chrome, it's the fastest.
 3) Requires IE8+, Firefox, Chrome or sufficient JavaScript support.
 4) Mobile Safari only works with iPhone4 or newer devices.
    Older devices timeout while executing JavaScript.
 5) DO NOT use Opera Mini it renders JavaScript output server side, therefore
    they might record the private key you generated.
 6) Art Wallet does not work properly in IE8 due to CSS limitations.
